# concealZippo
universal zippo lighter holder, with an infinite possibility to create your own attachments

Most of us own a zippo lighter but where do you carry it. This becoes a problem for many of us, especially the ones whose pockets are full of other "useful" edc gear. So why not get yourself a copy of these files, design a fitting back spacer just for yourself, and carry this undying source of fire.

Renders of this bare model are to be seen below.
